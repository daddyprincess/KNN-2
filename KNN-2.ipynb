    "    ~KNN can struggle with imbalanced datasets, where one class or outcome is significantly more prevalent than others.\n",
    "    ~Solution:\n",
    "        ~Implement techniques like oversampling the minority class, undersampling the majority class, or using different\n",
    "        evaluation metrics (e.g., F1-score) to account for class imbalance.\n",
    "        \n",
    "6. Categorical Data:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ~KNN primarily works with numerical data, and handling categorical features can be challenging.\n",
    "    ~Solution:\n",
    "        ~Convert categorical data to numerical representations (e.g., one-hot encoding).\n",
    "        ~Use distance metrics suitable for categorical data (e.g., Hamming distance).\n",
    "        \n",
    "7. Data Sparsity:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ~In recommendation systems or text analysis, data can be extremely sparse, making it difficult to find meaningful\n",
    "    neighbors.\n",
    "    ~Solution:\n",
    "        ~Utilize specialized techniques for sparse data, such as collaborative filtering or content-based filtering.\n",
    "        ~Incorporate dimensionality reduction or matrix factorization methods.\n",
    "        \n",
    "8. Storage Requirements:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ~For large datasets, storing all training data points and their labels can consume substantial memory.\n",
    "    ~Solution:\n",
    "        ~Consider using approximate nearest neighbor search algorithms that reduce the storage requirements while\n",
    "        maintaining reasonable accuracy.\n",
    "        \n",
    "9. Computational Complexity During Prediction:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ~Making predictions with KNN can be computationally expensive, especially if the dataset is large and the value of k \n",
    "    is large.\n",
    "    ~Solution:\n",
    "        ~Optimize prediction time by precomputing distances for frequently used data points or caching distances for \n",
    "        efficient retrieval.\n",
    "        \n",
    "10. Distance Metric Selection:\n",
    "    - The choice of distance metric can impact KNN's performance, and selecting the appropriate metric is not always\n",
    "    straightforward.\n",
    "    - Solution:\n",
    "        - Experiment with multiple distance metrics based on the data's characteristics and use cross-validation to \n",
    "        evaluate performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, addressing these drawbacks often involves a combination of data preprocessing, parameter tuning, and selecting\n",
    "the appropriate distance metric. Additionally, considering alternative algorithms like decision trees, support vector\n",
    "machines, or neural networks may be beneficial in scenarios where KNN faces significant challenges."
